function hfig = tightfig(hfig)
% tightfig: Alters a figure so that it has the minimum size necessary to
% enclose all axes in the figure without excess space around them.
% 
% Note that tightfig will expand the figure to completely encompass all
% axes if necessary. If any 3D axes are present which have been zoomed,
% tightfig will produce an error, as these cannot easily be dealt with.
% 
% hfig - handle to figure, if not supplied, the current figure will be used
% instead.
